Piccolo Admin detects your preferred language based on your browser settings, and will try and translate the UI accordingly, if we have a matching translation available.

You can also manually select your preferred language, using the new button in the nav bar, shown in the image above.

The languages we support for now are:

 * Croatian
 * French
 * German
 * Portuguese
 * Spanish
 * Welsh

Some of these were provided by native speakers of the language (Croatian, Portuguese), and the rest are machine translated. If you find any errors in our translations, or would like to contribute translations for another language, here's a [guide on how to contribute](https://piccolo-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html#translations). It should only take a few minutes, and is very appreciated!
