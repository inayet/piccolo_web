Piccolo now has support for [CockroachDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CockroachDB).

CockroachDB is a highly fault tolerant database, written in Golang. It uses a similar SQL syntax to Postgres, which makes it easier to integrate with existing Posgres tools like Piccolo.

It's an exciting development, and we're proud to support another production-grade database.
