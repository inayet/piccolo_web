We give an overview of [Piccolo](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo) and [FastAPI](https://piccolo-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fastapi/index.html), and show how you can create a movie database, with an API and admin interface in record time.

The [slides are available to download](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/pymdb/raw/master/pydata_global_presentation.pdf).

The [code used in the demo is also available](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/pymdb/).
