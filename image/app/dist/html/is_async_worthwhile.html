<p>One of the main motivations for building Piccolo was the lack of options for an asyncio ORM.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-asyncio-">What is asyncio?</h2>
<p>asyncio is a library added in Python 3, to provide an event loop implementation in the standard library.</p>
<p>Prior to this, each framework that implemented non-blocking IO via an event loop had their own event loop implementation, limiting interoperability (Twisted and Tornado being by far the most well known).</p>
<h2 id="why-is-an-event-loop-useful-">Why is an event loop useful?</h2>
<p>An event loop is one approach to concurrency. The others are:</p>
<ul>
<li>threads</li>
<li>processes</li>
<li>greenlets (lightweight, non-system threads)</li>
<li>implicit yielding (gevent, and eventlet)</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Asyncio helps improve throughput, not raw speed.</p>
<p>However, most frameworks built on top of asyncio have sought to increase performance, but through other means (efficient HTTP parsing, Cython-ising slow parts) ...</p>
