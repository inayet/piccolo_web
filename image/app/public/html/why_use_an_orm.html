<h3 id="passing-around-partial-queries">Passing around partial queries</h3>
<p>With Piccolo, you can pass around queries, and keep on chaining methods onto it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">query = Pokemon.select(&#39;name&#39;)

if some_param == True:
    query = query.where(Pokemon.power &gt;= 100)</code></pre>
<p>Doing this with raw SQL strings quickly becomes unmanageable.</p>

<p>The Piccolo ORM covers the most common interactions an app will have to make with a database.</p>
<p>In cases where it&#39;s not possible, you can just drop down into raw SQL.</p>

<h2 id="downsides-of-an-orm">Downsides of an ORM</h2>
<p>ORMs aren&#39;t without their issues.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>When you use an ORM, there is inevitable extra overhead in generating the SQL.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll sometimes hear people complain that an ORM generates inefficient SQL. This is usually only for very complex queries.</p>
<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with writing raw SQL, but with Piccolo it means you don&#39;t have to write it 90% of the time.</p>
<p>Piccolo also makes it easy to see the SQL being executed - just print any query.</p>
<h3 id="can-be-tedious-to-learn">Can be tedious to learn</h3>
<p>A lot of ORMs have their own terminology which doesn&#39;t match closely to SQL.</p>
<p>Over time, learning an ORM can feel tedious - you know SQL, but you&#39;re having to re-learn concepts over and over for each ORM you use.</p>
