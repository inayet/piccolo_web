# Is async worthwhile?

One of the main motivations for building Piccolo was the lack of options for an asyncio ORM.

## What is asyncio?

asyncio is a library added in Python 3, to provide an event loop implementation in the standard library.

Prior to this, each framework that implemented non-blocking IO via an event loop had their own event loop implementation, limiting interoperability (Twisted and Tornado being by far the most well known).

## Why is an event loop useful?

An event loop is one approach to concurrency. The others are:

 * threads
 * processes
 * greenlets (lightweight, non-system threads)
 * implicit yielding (gevent, and eventlet)

## What does asyncio give us?

## Does my corner shop's website need asyncio?

Probably not.

Asyncio helps improve throughput, not raw speed.

However, most frameworks built on top of asyncio have sought to increase performance, but through other means (efficient HTTP parsing, Cython-ising slow parts) ...
